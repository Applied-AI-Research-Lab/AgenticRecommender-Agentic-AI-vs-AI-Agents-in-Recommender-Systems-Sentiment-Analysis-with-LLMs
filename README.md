## Abstract
This paper explores the performance and synergy between Agentic AI systems and standalone AI Agents in the context of recommender systems through a sentiment analysis experiment. Using the Amazon Reviews ’23 dataset from McAuley Lab, a balanced subset of 5,000 verified purchase reviews—each including title, text, and rating—was created to ensure data authenticity. Twelve different state-of-the-art pre-trained large language models (LLMs) were employed in a zero-shot setting to predict sentiment ratings based on review content. In the first phase, each LLM acted independently as an AI Agent, generating predictions on the test set. In the second phase, an Agentic AI framework was implemented, where a reasoning orchestrator coordinated the predictions of the multiple AI Agents and derived a final decision. Two different reasoning orchestrators were tested to assess consistency and adaptability. The results are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, computational cost, and time. Findings reveal key insights into how Agentic AI architectures compare with isolated AI Agents in performing sentiment analysis for recommender systems, highlighting trade-offs between collaborative intelligence, reasoning overhead, and performance efficiency. The study provides a foundational step toward integrating multi-agent orchestration within next-generation recommender systems powered by Agentic AI.
